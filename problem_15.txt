I am trying to implement this bit of code:

func factorial(x int) (result int) {
  if x == 0 {
    result = 1;
  } else {
    result = x * factorial(x - 1);
  }
  return;
}

as a big.Int so as to make it effective for larger values of x.

The following is returning a value of 0 for 	fmt.Println(factorial(r))

The factorial of 7 should be 5040?

Any ideas on what I am doing wrong?
