# Euler-Go

This repository contains some of my solutions to Project Euler problems implemented in the Go programming language.

> **Note:** These solutions are in a preliminary state and may benefit from refactoring and optimization. Contributions and suggestions for improvement are welcome!

## About Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. Each problem requires creative problem solving and programming skills, making it a great platform to practice and improve coding abilities.

## Structure

Each file in this repository typically corresponds to a single Project Euler problem. The code is written in Go, with the aim of solving the problems efficiently, though many solutions can be further improved and refactored.

## Getting Started

To run any of the solutions, ensure you have [Go installed](https://golang.org/doc/install).

You can run a particular solution with:

```bash
go run problemXX.go
```

(replace `problemXX.go` with the appropriate file name)

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests with refactored code, optimizations, or additional solutions.
