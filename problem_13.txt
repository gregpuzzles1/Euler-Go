I have been learning the Go programming language by doing some of the Project Euler problems. I am now on
problem 13. It contains an external file with 100 lines of 50 digit numbers. My question is: How can this file
be read into a Go program and worked with? Does Go have a readlines function? I've read about the io and ioutil
packages, and about all I can come up with is reading in the file and printing it; however, I am not sure how
to work with the file... Can it be assigned to a variable? Is there a readlines function, etc...

Any help would be appreaciated.

Here is what I have so far:

package main

import "fmt"
import "io/ioutil"

func main() {
	fmt.Println(ioutil.ReadFile("one-hundred_50.txt"))
}
